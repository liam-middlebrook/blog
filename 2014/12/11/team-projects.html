          <h2>A Note on Large Team Projects</h2>
<p class="meta">11 Dec 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Over the course of this term I have been working on a large team project
(at least large for the scale that academia usually works at). I can&#39;t
talk in much detail about the project itself but I will describe
some of the more abstract experiences and things that I have
learned when workin on a larger team project. Because of
the amount of communication that goess on within a large team I will
be splitting this post up into two different blog posts.</p>

<p>As with every team project I&#39;ve noticed that communication is key.
With most of the group projects that I have been involved in
in the past the group would meet a maximum of two times per week (that number
being on the hopeful side). This project has been immensely different; one
of the largest takeaways from this project can be summed up in the simple
statement of:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Without strong and constant communication teamwork will cease and
deadlines will be lost, leaving the project in a permanent &quot;Catch Up&quot; state</p>
</blockquote>
