          <h2>A Note on Large Team Projects [2]</h2>
<p class="meta">11 Dec 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>In my last post I started to talk about the importance of constant
communication when working on a large team project. After working on
teams of all sizes with members who had various levels of communication
I can certainly say this is where most teams simply fail. Sadly the aspect
of communication isn&#39;t that which will hurt the team the most when working
on a project.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed time and time again with projects I&#39;ve worked on that the process
of creating a product is what is most neglected. It&#39;s a wonderful thing to see
something just work, but when others are not able to replicate and learn from
the process one could ask if the project even mattered. Some people would say
&quot;Of course this project mattered, I worked on X, Y, and Z. This entire project
works, why wouldn&#39;t that be a success?&quot;</p>

<p>This is where I find the issue with how we are taught to do projects in school.
More often than not I will see teams work on an awesome project and once they
have finished it just leaving it to sit on their portfolio. In some of the
classes people are required to do postmortems to help them reflect on the
process that went into the creation. </p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t think that postmortems make the cut for documenting the
development process. They only provide a brief overview of one&#39;s thoughts after
working on a project. Because of this they classicly neglect the different
hopes and goals that evolved throughout the projects lifetime.</p>

<p>A possible alternative to relying on postmortems for the documentation process
of development would be to encourage students to use issue trackers such as
Trello, Jira, or GitHub. Having these issues tied in with commits also
helps track the development process because we are able to tie in different
sections of the codebase with different issues.</p>
