          <h2>OSI Licenses Full: A FOSS Project Bootstrapping Tool</h2>
<p class="meta">11 Nov 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>This weekend I started to work on a project for my ADVFOSS class.
As usual when I started the project I wanted to choose a license;
Normally I would just use the GitHub online interface to create
a new repository for me that has run <code>git init</code> and added LICENSE and README
files. Instead I decided to pull down a nice markdown formatted version of
my license of choice, I got that file from <a href="https://github.com/timoxley/osi-licenses-full">timoxley/osi-licenses-full</a>.</p>

<p>I really like using osi-licenses-full when I want to pull down the texts of
various FOSS licenses. The only issue is that this requires an active internet
connection and I always manage to forget the URL of the repository. I thought
about how much faster it would be if all I needed to create a license file for
a new project was to run a command and I decided that I was going to fork
osi-licenses-full into a Python terminal script.</p>

<p>My version of osi-licenses-full is hosted on <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/osi_licenses_full">PyPi</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/liam-middlebrook/osi-licenses-full">GitHub</a>. It is
downloadable via the command <code>pip install osi_licenses_full</code></p>
