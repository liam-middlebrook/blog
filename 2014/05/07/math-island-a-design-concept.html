          <h2>Math Island: A Design Concept</h2>
<p class="meta">07 May 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<h2>Preface</h2>

<p>Over the course of this term in my Mathematics of Graphical Simulation class my friends and I have had an "interesting" time in class. The first few weeks of the course I had noticed that something wasn't going exactly the proper way that a math primer for graphics programming should be taught. As the course went on my friends started the have a harder time understand what was going on in class. With this new difficulty, and the fact that our tables are arranged in a small archipelago like group format they came up with the concept of Math Island.</p>

<h2>Math Island</h2>

<p>Math Island is a place of exile and torment. Prisoners are sent to Math Island with only one way to escape, via solving their escape plan. For any action or event to occur on Math Island, it has to be calculated before the fact.</p>

<h2>The Game</h2>

<p>You are trapped on Math Island, in order to escape you must navigate through it's maze-like structure. In order to make your way out, you must collect fuel cells before you run out of fuel. Every move you take uses a bit more fuel, escape the island using a combination of skill and wit!</p>
