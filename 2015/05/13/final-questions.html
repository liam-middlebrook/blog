<div class="post">
<ul>
<li><p>When does code you create become copyrighted?
As soon is you write it. Typically people say when it&#39;s saved to the disk,
but that could be easily taken advantage of by forcing workers to work in
RAMDISK environments in order to exploit free code from them.</p></li>
<li><p>If you could wave a magic wand, and open source any piece of proprietary software, what software would you choose?
Microsoft Windows, in hopes that it would improve the Open Source development
support on Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>If the software above was open sourced, would itâ€™s company remain stable? How would the company continue to make money?
I don&#39;t think Microsoft would have a problem remaining stable, to my
understanding they make a lot of money off of services.</p></li>
<li><p>What do you feel like was the most beneficial thing to learn in the class?
Trademark and Patent Law.</p></li>
<li><p>Explain the some of the motivations a company may have to open source software?
A security company can prove it&#39;s legitimacy through opening their source.</p></li>
<li><p>Are there any changes you would suggest making to the profile template?  What parts did you find most interesting or important?
I think that the community section would need to be extended more. I think
having a full commarch report would be useful.</p></li>
<li><p>If you could have spent more time, say an extra week, on any topic, which would you have liked to cover more in depth?
I would have liked to spend time on Non-Disclosure and Non-Compete Agreements.</p></li>
<li><p>Why are you using license <strong>insert license X here</strong>  for your open source project?
I don&#39;t have a default license for my projects. I feel that licenses should
be chosen based on the intended use of the software.</p></li>
<li><p>If you would suggest a video to be watched as part of this course, what would it be?
Yes, I think we should watch my birth prophecy, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_%28film%29">Hackers</a></p></li>
