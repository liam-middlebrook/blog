          <h2>Integrating Spotify With Javascript</h2>
<p class="meta">26 Apr 2015</p>

<div class="post">
<p>In my Research Studio class I&#39;m currently working on a project that creates
audio visualizations using Javascript and <a href="http://threejs.org/">three.js</a>. So
far we&#39;ve been using APIs like <a href="http://www.sonicapi.com/">sonicAPI</a> in order
to process the data from local sound files. We&#39;ve also experimented with using
the HTML5 WebAudio API, but either way the user has the duty to provide their
own music for visualization.</p>

<p>Placing the burden of having a full-featured music library on the user is not
something that our professor was okay with. Instead he recommended that we
look into different music streaming APIs in order to provide a more full
experience for the user. The following services and their APIs were explored.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://grooveshark.com">Grooveshark</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://spotify.com">Spotify</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>I personally looked heavily into the Spotify API.</p>

<p>Spotify offers a variety of API endpoints for developers who decide to
use their service. The first one that I looked into was the Spotify Native API
or <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/">libspotify</a> as
it&#39;s more commonly known.</p>

<p>While exploring the features of libspotify I noticed a few key elements that
increased its difficulty of use.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A Native Secret Key is Required</p></li>
<li><p>All music data is streamed in 16 bit Little Endian 4.41kHz (Uncompressed CD)</p></li>
<li><p>libspotify bindings are in C</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The first thing I did was look for NodeJS wrappers for the libspotify C
library. I was lucky enough to find two different libraries that wrapped
libspotify for use with NodeJS. <a href="https://github.com/FrontierPsychiatrist/node-spotify">FrontierPsychiatrist/node-spotify</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/Floby/node-libspotify">Floby/node-libspotify</a>. Sadly
after getting both of these libraries to work beautifully on my Linux machine
I learned that neither of them would support Windows.</p>

<p>For about a day I looked into compiling versions of these libraries to run on
Windows, and arrived at the conclusion that I usually run into while developing
for Windows: If something needs to use external libraries, it won&#39;t be fun to
compile on Windows.</p>

<p>Luckily I found a NodeJS Spotify Wrapper that uses the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/">Spotify Web API</a>.
After about 10 minutes of mucking around trying to get a nice example* setup.</p>

<p>* An example that wouldn&#39;t require me typing my username and password into
a plaintext file.</p>

<p>This wrapper works wonderfully and retrieves the songs in MP3 format, which
makes for easy integration with SonicAPI and the WebAudio API.</p>
