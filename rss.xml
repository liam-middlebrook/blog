      <title>Integrating Spotify With Javascript</title>
      <link>http://gearchicken.com/blog/2015/04/26/spotify-js.html</link>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[In my Research Studio class I&amp;#39;m currently working on a project that creates
audio visualizations using Javascript and three.js. So
far we&amp;#39;ve been using APIs like sonicAPI in order
to process the data from local sound files. We&amp;#39;ve also experimented with using
the HTML5 WebAudio API, but either way the user has the duty to provide their
own music for visualization.

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[Today I finally decided that it would be a good idea to be able to read
what I write. I&amp;#39;ve been experimenting back and forth with different Vim
colorschemes and terminal color settings for the past few months. I finally
have found what I consider the most pleasing color scheme.

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[This is a step by step guide on how to setup TravisCI for FIRST Robotics C++
repositories. It will cover getting build status from TravisCI, but it will
not go into unit testing. If you want to explore setting up Unit Tests for
your repository I would recommend looking into CUnit.

      <link>http://gearchicken.com/blog/2015/03/05/thoughts-on-vulkan.html</link>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[Earlier today at the Game Developers Conference in San
Fansisco the Khronos Group presented the next version,
or rather the successor to OpenGL. Vulkan is a
lower level Graphics API that puts developers in control of the hardware,
rather than leaving all of the &amp;quot;heavy lifting&amp;quot; to the driver.

sign labeled &amp;quot;Frog Fractions 2.&amp;quot; When I walked up to the booth I saw what
appeared to be a golfing game. I stood behind someone for about 10 minutes,
I was pretty confused, waiting for the change in gameplay that I remember from
the original Frog Fractions.

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[A few weeks ago one of my friends asked me about the possibility of setting
up online forum software for a community that he&amp;#39;s part of. He also had
mentioned that he wanted to avoid using any Forum Software that was written
in PHP. We also wanted to make sure they we had a free hosting solution, so
we went with OpenShift and NodeBB.

      <title>A Note on Large Team Projects [2]</title>
      <link>http://gearchicken.com/blog/2014/12/11/team-projects-2.html</link>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[In my last post I started to talk about the importance of constant
communication when working on a large team project. After working on
teams of all sizes with members who had various levels of communication
I can certainly say this is where most teams simply fail. Sadly the aspect
of communication isn&amp;#39;t that which will hurt the team the most when working
on a project.

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[Over the course of this term I have been working on a large team project
(at least large for the scale that academia usually works at). I can&amp;#39;t
talk in much detail about the project itself but I will describe
some of the more abstract experiences and things that I have
learned when workin on a larger team project. Because of
the amount of communication that goess on within a large team I will
be splitting this post up into two different blog posts.

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[As part of my contribution to the 24 days of Pull Requests. I decided
to fix a potential bug in golddiamonds/BreakOuttaHere.
I fixed an issue where they were going through the game loop by executing
a sleep command with an arbitrary literal number. This is an issue
because not all computers run at the same CPU clock speed, leaving
users with slower computers at an advantage.

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[This weekend I started to work on a project for my ADVFOSS class.
As usual when I started the project I wanted to choose a license;
Normally I would just use the GitHub online interface to create
a new repository for me that has run git init and added LICENSE and README
files. Instead I decided to pull down a nice markdown formatted version of
my license of choice, I got that file from timoxley/osi-licenses-full.

      <title>C++11 Support with Travis-CI using g++</title>
      <link>http://gearchicken.com/blog/2014/07/02/c11-support-with-travis-ci-using-g.html</link>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[Today I was working on adding Travis-CI support to my project 
MINX and I came across an issue that had 
happened to several people, but no single source had the solution. 
I compile MINX with g++ (just because that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m used to). 
A few things inside of MINX require C++11 so I&amp;#39;d normally just add 
a * -std=c++11 * argument in my makefile.

David McCandless

What:

Common Rhetological Fallacies

Where:

Common Rhetological Fallacies [ PNG ]

When:

Released April, 2012

The Gist:

This image contains lists of example of different common rhetological fallacies. Each fallacy comes with an example, and a small descriptive image to represent the fallacy.

The Good:


Pictures are Easy to Understand
Fallacies are sorted into color-coded sections
All the sources are cited at the bottom of the image


The Bad:


Some of the fallacies may seem oversimplified
All of the authors and citations appear at the very bottom of the image, where the sources are in a small font


The Questions:


What fallacies did not make onto the list and why?
How can reading this document help public speakers with the art of rhetoric?
Could some of the sections be split into smaller subsections (while still remaining useful)?


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Overall I found this list of fallacies interesting; when reading through the examples I found quite a few fallacies that I commonly use in arguments. I hope if I were to get nothing else from this picture that it helps me eliminate the use of those fallacies in my speech. 9/10 Dropped Packets

      <title>BarCamp - An Unconference</title>
      <link>http://gearchicken.com/blog/2014/05/12/barcamp-an-unconference.html</link>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[Preface:

I have no easy way of describing all of the things that BarCamp is, so I have included the &quot;official&quot; description of BarCamp below, as according to their site http://barcamproc.org

BarCamp Rochester is an ad-hoc gathering born from the desire for people to share and learn in an open environment. BarCamp Rochester is an intense event with discussions, demos, and interaction from attendees. All attendees should give a demo, a session, or help with one. All presentations are scheduled the day they happen. Prepare in advance, but come early to get a good slot on the schedule.

&amp;nbsp;

This year I was only able to attend a single talk at BarCamp due to some preoccupations that involve an aforementioned math class from my last blog post. Either way, the talk that I was able to attend wasn't quite &quot;normal,&quot; to me, even for BarCamp's standards.

Given the nature of the entire presentation behind this talk I'm going to turn this into a constructive piece on how this speaker could have done better.

The Talk:

The name of the talk was &quot;How to Not NOT Sell Video Games.&quot; I'm going to list off all the tips I can think off in a bulleted form:


Don't try to force audience interaction
Make sure that you project your voice, but avoid shouting at your audience
Practice your slide deck a few times before presenting it
Always be prepared for the worst of Murphy's Law
Check your facts before showing them to others
Don't hold your audience captive

      <title>Math Island: A Design Concept</title>
      <link>http://gearchicken.com/blog/2014/05/07/math-island-a-design-concept.html</link>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[Preface

Over the course of this term in my Mathematics of Graphical Simulation class my friends and I have had an &quot;interesting&quot; time in class. The first few weeks of the course I had noticed that something wasn't going exactly the proper way that a math primer for graphics programming should be taught. As the course went on my friends started the have a harder time understand what was going on in class. With this new difficulty, and the fact that our tables are arranged in a small archipelago like group format they came up with the concept of Math Island.

Math Island

Math Island is a place of exile and torment. Prisoners are sent to Math Island with only one way to escape, via solving their escape plan. For any action or event to occur on Math Island, it has to be calculated before the fact.

The Game

You are trapped on Math Island, in order to escape you must navigate through it's maze-like structure. In order to make your way out, you must collect fuel cells before you run out of fuel. Every move you take uses a bit more fuel, escape the island using a combination of skill and wit!

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[Last month on Tuesday the 18th, students from both my HFOSS class as well as students 
from the Advanced FOSS class were supposed to go to March&amp;#39;s RocPy meeting. When I had 
arrived with my car, ready to carpool some of the students over I was the only person 
who had brought their car. After waiting for about 10 minutes nobody else had arrived 
with a vehicle that was suitable for driving others in. After making a few calls a few
people gave up and decided not to go to RocPy. The remainder of us piled into my car 
and made the long (15 minute) journey to the University of Rochester.
The remainder of this blogpost will be in code below.

      <title>Curriculum Review - 4th Grade Math for MA and NY</title>
      <link>http://gearchicken.com/blog/2014/04/09/curriculum-review-4th-grade-math-for-ma-and-ny.html</link>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[Overview

In my Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software course we are researching the 4th Grade math curriculum for students in both Massachusetts and New York. Our assignment involved reading over a few texts the covered both curricula. I have included links to those texts below:


http://hfoss-fossrit.rhcloud.com/static/decks/nysp12cclsmath-grade4only.pdf
http://hfoss-fossrit.rhcloud.com/static/decks/nysp12cclsmath.pdf
http://hfoss-fossrit.rhcloud.com/static/decks/MA-0111-grade4only.pdf
http://hfoss-fossrit.rhcloud.com/static/decks/MA-0111.pdf


&amp;nbsp;

Similarities

Both curricula are designed to cover the same topics, and because of that largely have the same information. A lot of the examples used in the documents are shared between states, which I believe is a good thing because it helps unify education across regions, rather than separate it.

Differences

I did not notice any differences (apart from wording) in the texts for the 4th Grade Mathematics Curriculum.

Useful Information

I think that the section covering number operations in base ten will be most useful for my groups game. It will be easy enough programmatically to multiply and divide multi-digit numbers in base 10. Also given the nature of how my team's game is designed we should be able to have levels progress in an order that reinforces the four basic math operations and their uses.

      <title>Allowing SteamOS to Install Packages From Debian Wheezy With Aptitude</title>
      <link>http://gearchicken.com/blog/2014/03/30/allowing-steamos-to-install-packages-from-debian-wheezy-with-aptitude.html</link>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[The Meeting

Last Wednesday I had a meeting with Andy Phelps the director of RIT's MAGIC center. I was requesting permission to use the MAGIC center's labs for developing MINX for SteamOS. Below I have included a paraphrased transcription of our meeting:

Me: &quot;I was wondering if I would be able to use the MAGIC center's Steambox to develop my custom game framework?&quot;
Andy: &quot;Yes.&quot;

The Quest

Later that day I went into the MAGIC Lab to use the Steam Machine. When I logged into a virtual terminal I tried to install Git so I would be able to clone my repository for MINX. That's when I found out that a source list containing Git was not included in the default Alchemist /etc/apt/sources.list file.  I thought to myself  *If Git is missing what else might be missing?*

Two nights ago @brpylko and I went back into the MAGIC lab determined to fix the sources.list file to allow SteamOS to also download Debian packages if they were not already given from the Alchemist package list. We had found two different tutorials, at first one that was generic to any environment using the Advanced Packaging Tool (the first link below.) The second tutorial we had found was on the Steam Community page, while it was specific to SteamOS it still had a few errors that caused the sources to not download properly.

http://jaqque.sbih.org/kplug/apt-pinning.html

http://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamuniverse/discussions/1/648814396114274132/

The Solution

For this tutorial I'm going to assume that you already have access to a terminal on your SteamBox that has sudo access.

First off open up the terminal and change directory to &quot;/etc/apt/&quot; this can be done by the command

cd /etc/apt/

Second off we will need to edit the sources.list file. Nano is a simple text editor in terminal with a shallow learning curve, so I'll be using that for this tutorial. This can be done with the commnad

sudo nano sources.list

Once you have opened up sources.list go to the bottom of the file in add in your debian mirror of choice. I'm going to put the default mirror for simplicity. The two lines that you add to your sources.list file should look similar to the following

deb ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ wheezy main contrib non-free
deb-src ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ wheezy main contrib non-free

After you have done that it's time to save and close the sources.list file.

Now we need to change our APT Preferences file. Please Note: Some users may not have an existing APT Preferences file. Either way you'll have to open/create an /etc/apt/preferences file. I'll be using the command

sudo nano /etc/apt/preferences

Once you have the file open we need to add the following lines to it

Package: *
Pin: release l=SteamOS
Pin-Priority: 900
&amp;nbsp;
Package: *
Pin: release l=Debian
Pin-Priority: 10

What you typed above tells APT that it should prioritize downloading packages that are included in the SteamOS list, but also to download packages from the Debian package list.

To finalize your changes to the APT settings run the following command.

sudo apt-get update

Now you should be able to download packages from the Debian repository!

To test this out you should run the following two commands.

sudo apt-get install cowsay fortune
fortune | cowsay

If everything worked correctly you should have an ASCII cow draw in your terminal screen and tell you a random line from the fortunes list file!

      <title>Community Architecture Analysis: MonoGame</title>
      <link>http://gearchicken.com/blog/2014/03/19/community-architecture-analysis-monogame.html</link>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[What we did:

My team and I researched MonoGame primarily through its Github page, main website, and Google.  Before the project, I had crawled through the MonoGame source and interacted with its developers on Github.  We attempted to augment our own research with git_by_a_bus, but the way the git_by_a_bus was written caused it to keep eating up the machine's memory.

Some context and history: 

&quot;From the website:  MonoGame is an Open Source implementation of the Microsoft XNA 4 Framework. Our goal is to allow XNA developers on Xbox 360, Windows &amp;amp; Windows Phone to port their games to the iOS, Android, Mac OS X, Linux and Windows 8 Metro.  PlayStation Mobile, Raspberry PI, and PlayStation 4 platforms are currently in progress.

In 2009 José Antonio Leal de Farias, an active member of the XNA community, started an open source project called XNA Touch with the goal of porting simple 2D XNA games to mobile devices.  He started from Bill Reiss’s SilverSprite and some bits of Mono.XNA and in December 2009 the first release which only supported iPhone was posted on Codeplex.
...
In March 2011 the project was renamed MonoGame and was moved to GitHub.  That same year support for Android, Mac, Linux, and OpenGL on Windows appeared.  Dominique Louis who joined the project in 2009 took over as the full time project lead.&quot;

What is the community?

Monogame has had 8 main developers over the course of its entire life.  Currently there are 4 : Steve Williams, Tom Spilman, Andrea Magnorksy, and Jacob Anderson, who also approve patches.  Over the course of the project there have been 138 contributors, and 6,089 commits.  Tom Spilman acts as the lead developer for the project, and is probably the best person to contact if you have additional questions.

Monogame has a large community of developers behind it, which has steadily been growing as more and more indie developers use it and give credence to the project's credibility and stability.

Would the project survive the raptor test or if 20% of contributers were killed?

My assumption is that because monogame is starting to get essential, and because the people using it are in a position to also write code for it, it would get picked up again.  While killing a large portion of the developers would be a huge detriment to the project, it would probably recover. One of monogame's strengths is that its userbase is often involved in development - this means that there are a lot of people with stake in the project, and an ability to code and improve upon it.

Monogame's Documentation/ Bug Reporting/ Quickstarts to contributing: 

Monogame has a large amount of documentation by pure virtue of being able to use most of the old XNA documentation.  It's very easy to start using.

The source code itself is also well documented; there's a good quickstart guide and the code is well-commented.  Outside of that though, you'll be somewhat on your own as to finding what bugs/features to work on.

Bugs/issues/milestones are managed through GitHub's issue tracker, which is managed by the lead developers.  This is also where most of the conversations take place - it's here you'll find talks about release schedules, future changes and merges, and so on.  Monogame has no mailing list and little activity on any IRC channel.

Is contributing to Monogame right for you?

It depends on what you want.  Monogame isn't terrifically helpful getting you set up or helping you through problems.  That may be something you like (independence, less scheduled accountability) or it may be a problem for you (less help when you run into problems, harder to talk about specific issues, harder to get people to work on things)

Any conclusions?


There are a small number of people in charge, but those people are taking input from a large number of independent contrubuters, each with a fair amount of power over the direction.  Merging in large amounts of code requires communication and getting to know the community.
There is a large sense of independence in the project.  The largest amounts of development are being done in forks by other people, and then after significant amounts of development (getting a game released, etc...) then merging it back in.  There are positives and negatives to this approach.
The community doesn't do a great job holding your hand, but there's room to experiment. There's a strong DUI ethos, at least that we saw.


Callaway Coefficient of Fail : 

For what I had seen from FOSS development in the past the standards of the Callaway Coefficient of Fail were no surprise to me. The FOSS community isn't all the sunshine and rainbows that my professor may paint it out to be; a lot of the FOSS community is highly critical of Windows and proprietary software developers.

Our assessment: 

Monogame is here to stay.  The community is still growing and the project is still maturing, but nothing's going to get rid of it anytime soon.  It is, by all sane measures, a highly successful project.

      <title>Making Robots Drive</title>
      <link>http://gearchicken.com/blog/2014/03/17/making-robots-drive.html</link>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[Over RIT's Intersession, a break from classes lasting almost the entire month of January, I went back to my old High School to help mentor their FIRST Robotics Team.  When I was on the team I was the lead of their programming sub-team, so coming back it was a no-brainer what I would be asked to help out on. In previous years the team had used Java to program the robot, it was simple enough that new team members would be able to pick it up in the few months we has before the actual build season started. But this year I came back to the surprise that the new lead of Programming had switched the coding language of choice to C++.

I love C++ it's a great language it it does a lot of things in a way that makes sense to me, personally I wish that people took the effort to port more things to D, but that's a story for another blog post. I just don't feel that C++ is a good language for beginner programmers, especially those who's idea of writing a program is: Tracking a Killers Address in a Visual Basic Program.

When I went back to visit the team I got the questions that would be expected of most beginners learning C++. &quot;Can you explain pointers?&quot; &quot;Why do I need to delete variables?&quot; &quot;Is real programming really this hard?&quot; I tried my best to help recover the students so they wouldn't fall to the trap of thinking that C++ is a language that isn't worth the effort it takes to learn.

Most of all my experience going back to mentor the team reminded me how much I loved  Engineering and Electronics. One thing I want to make time to do in my schedule among the cloud of software projects that I created is to work on a small electronics project. After all it's why I got my RaspberryPi last year.

      <title>HFOSS - Commarch Team Proposal</title>
      <link>http://gearchicken.com/blog/2014/03/13/hfoss-comarch-team-proposal.html</link>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[List of Team Members




Name
email


Liam Middlebrook
ljm2906@rit.edu


Brian Escriche
bke2759@rit.edu


Dan Shumway
drs7453@rit.edu




Which project did your team choose?

MonoGame

2-liner description of the project?

MonoGame is a port of Microsoft's XNA Game Framework to the Mono language. MonoGame takes the features provided by XNA and allows for cross-platform deployment.

What will each team member's role be?

Believable answer, something that might go as a title on a resume (emphasis on believable.)

Source Code Repository URL?

https://github.com/mono/MonoGame

What are the easy parts?


MonoGame is a very active project on GitHub (link provided above)
MonoGame has a somewhat active forum on codeplex.com ( monogame.codeplex.com/discussions )
The MonoGame Core Dev Team is very active on Twitter ( https://twitter.com/MonoGameTeam )


What are the hard parts?


MonoGame's IRC is only somewhat active, this will provide a slight challenge when trying to communicate with the core dev team.
While MonoGame is an active project it has a long-term development cycle. It's last release was over a year ago.

      <title>The History of MINX (Part 1)</title>
      <link>http://gearchicken.com/blog/2014/02/26/the-history-of-minx-part-1.html</link>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[In January of 2013 I had seen articles saying that Microsoft was officially stopping development to update it's XNA Framework. When I heard this I was struck with sadness and memories knowing that without XNA I never would have become a Game Developer, and maybe not even a programmer.
A year or so before XNA was deprecated I grew to a point where I felt I needed to strive to program in something more challenging than XNA, something that would give me more control. I had always been told that C++ was a great language, and that it was &quot;The Industry Standard.&quot; On a whim I decided I would try to learn C++. As you might imagine this didn't turn out as well as I would have hoped, I spent about a week frustrating myself over tutorials on how to use SDL 1.2, yet I had never taken the time to understand what was going on in C++. It took less than a month of frustration before I decided that without proper knowledge C++ and SDL would be too annoying/difficult to use.
Last year after I was accepted into RIT's Game Design and Development program I decided that I wanted to come into the major making an impression that would last a lifetime. I talked to my friend Ben (https://github.com/bypylko) and asked if he would be interested in creating a clone of XNA in C++. We talked back and forth about licensing issues that would arise from doing this and concluded on something along the lines of &quot;If MonoGame is getting away with it why can't we?&quot; Because of our love/hate relationship with recursive acronyms we decided to name our (at the time) library, MINX. Meaning, MINX IS Not XNA.

Here are links to the MINX GitHub and Development Blog

To be continued. . .

      <title>Rochester Civic App Challenge Kickoff Hackathon</title>
      <link>http://gearchicken.com/blog/2014/02/24/rochester-civic-app-challenge-kickoff-hackathon.html</link>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[This past weekend myself, along with my friends Eric and Braxton participated in the Rochester Civic App Challenge Kickoff Hackathon. This kickoff was hosted by RIT's MAGIC Center and lasted from 6PM Friday Jan 21st to 6PM Saturday Jan 22nd.

Braxton, Eric, and I created CityWatch a browser based application that pinpoints the locations of 911 calls onto a map.  Our app received second place in the kickoff hackathon for new civic apps.

One interesting thing that we discovered during the hackathon was a bug (or feature!) in the API we were using to receive 911 call data. We had noticed that some points were appearing outside of Monroe county. After looking further into the issue we discovered a few datapoints in England. To be exact those points were from Brighton, England. I'm fairly sure that the scraper for the API that we used just looked for datapoints in towns that matched the names of towns in Monroe county.

For the rest of the challenge we plan to add filtering options so users will be able to view specific types of 911 calls (such as Ambulance, Fire, or Police). As well as expanding our dataset to receive 911 information from outside of Monroe County, NY.

      <title>Rochester AT&amp;T Civic App Challenge Press Conference</title>
      <link>http://gearchicken.com/blog/2014/02/24/rochester-att-civic-app-challenge-press-conference.html</link>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[The Gist:

RIT along with AT&amp;amp;T, Digital Rochester, High Tech Rochester, and Hack Upstate will be hosting a 60 day app creation challenge based around creating an app that exposes civic resources to the average citizen [Link Here].  Every sponsor of the event is clearly stating that they are doing it to once again start up Rochester's tech sector, hopefully bringing it back to the peak of the Kodak and Xerox years.

The Good:


The fact that recognition of the tech community in Rochester is happening from companies
The promotion of creating a more transparent government to help facilitate communication with citizens
The promotion of the Open Source Initiative


The Bad:


The challenge lasts an entire 60 days, which leaves ideas to a test of time. If a developer loses their passion for an idea the overall challenge loses a bit of quality.
The press conference looked more like companies trying to improve their public image
The Open Source Initiative was mentioned, rather than the Free Software Foundation (It seems that this is a recurring bulletin in &quot;The Bad&quot; for my posts)


Overall attending the conference was a good experience. It helped me realize who would be looking at the apps that are created during the challenge.

      <title>HW: Bugfix</title>
      <link>http://gearchicken.com/blog/2014/02/24/hw-bugfix.html</link>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[For my Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software class I was assigned to find a bug in a GitHub repository and to submit a pull request with a patch for the bug.  About a month ago I had discovered a python game development library known as Spyral. I have been watching Spyral for the past few weeks and decided to find a bug that was simple enough for someone with my python experience to handle. Here is a link to the pull request that I submitted to Spyral.

https://github.com/platipy/spyral/pull/39

When I submitted my pull request I had a great experience interacting with the lead developer acbart. He answered my question within a day of me submitting the pull request and helping to think out a solution to the issue that the bug presented. While ultimately my bugfix has not been implemented, I'd like to think that by submitting it I helped acbart work out a framework design choice for Spyral.

      <title>HFOSS - Quiz 1</title>
      <link>http://gearchicken.com/blog/2014/02/12/hfoss-quiz-1.html</link>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[In Chapter 3 of Stephen Weber's The Success of Open Source, there was a listing of eight &quot;General Principles&quot; contained within the chapter. Last week, we discussed in class the five pillars of &quot;The Open Source Way.&quot;

1.  What are the titles of each Pillar?


Open Exchange
Participation
Rapid Prototyping
Meritocracy
Community


2.  What are the titles of each General Principle?


Make It Interesting and Make Sure It Happens
Scratch an Itch
Minimize How Many Times You Have to Reinvent The Wheel
Solve Problems Through parallel Work Processes Whenever Possible
Leverage The Law of Large Numbers
Document What You Do
Release Early And Release Often
Talk A Lot


3.  What are the similarities between Weber's eight principles, and the five pillars?

The five Pillars of Open Source and Weber's eight principles all cover how Open Source developers should execute their development process.  Without the five pillars Weber's eight principles have no standing.
4.  What are the differences?

The Pillars of Open Source are more general guidelines on how Open Source  The General Principles of Open Source give broad examples of how an Open Source developer should go about in their development process.  For example the Pillar of Rapid Prototyping is brought to example by the General Principle of Release Early And Release Often.
5.  Bonus: Who's &quot;keen analysis&quot; did Weber &quot;Draw Heavily&quot; upon?&quot;

Eric S. Raymond
6.  Double-Bonus: What was the title of this &quot;keen analysis.&quot; (Hint: Weber hinted at the title when he was talking about Cathedrals earlier in the chapter.)

The Cathedral and The Bazaar
7.  Triple-Bonus: Where can this keen analysis be found? (Answer in URL form, i.e. http://placeofkeenanalysisis.com/analysis)

      <title>LitReview Weber - The Success of Open Source Chapter 3: What Is Open Source and How Does It Work?</title>
      <link>http://gearchicken.com/blog/2014/02/10/litreview-weber-the-success-of-open-source-chapter-3-what-is-open-source-and-how-does-it-work.html</link>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[On Novemeber 30th, 2005 Steven Weber released his book The Success of Open Source in the Harvard University Press.  For my Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS) class my professor asked us to read the third chapter of Weber's book, titled What Is Open Source and How Does It Work?  By no means do I feel comfortable formatting the article in the way most articles are formatted where paragraphs simply flow together. Instead I'll be taking the format the my professor had given the class as a rough outline.


&amp;nbsp;

Who:

Steven Weber - Professor of Political Science, University of California, Berkeley

What:

The Success of Open Source - Chapter 3: What Is Open Source and How Does It Work?

Where:

Although I have posted a link to the Amazon page for the book, below I have a link for a PDF version of Chapter 3.

Chapter 3: What Is Open Source and How Does It Work?

When:

Published November 30th, 2005

The Gist:

What Is Open Source and How Does It Work does a great job of covering the general idea and origins of the Open Source Software movement. It tells an outline of the story of Linus Torvalds and the origins of Linux, but merely graces over the Free Software Foundation only mentioning the organization twice in the chapter. It ends mentioning how while all Open Source projects are joined by the idea of sharing source code that they all differ in how they are organized.

The Good:


The Free Software Foundation is mentioned
The sense of community between Open Source developers is mentioned.
Mentioning that reusing code is encouraged, there's no sense in reinventing the wheel.


The Bad:


The difference between Free Software and Open Source Software was not made clear
On page 74 of the book (24 of the PDF) Weber uses the term &quot;Scratch an Itch&quot; I feel that this method causes developers to expect rewards from the community, rather than have rewards be a special occasion.
The chapter makes several comments on division of labor at the beginning, and then holds off until the end to describe how several major Open Source projects divide their labor.


The Questions:


How should new developers get into the Open Source community?
In what ways can Open Source licenses be applied to games without compromising the work of the artists who put work into such games?
At what point should developers say that the wheel is outdated and needs to be reinvented?


&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Overall I found this chapter to be informative for someone who is not already familiar with the world of Open Source Software. That being said certain people in my HFOSS class may not have gotten as much out of it because of our previous experiences with the Open Source community. As an article for newcomers I would rate it a 9 out of 10. I personally believe that more work should have been put forth to mention the Free Software Foundation and the distinction between Free Software and Open Source Software, but that's an ideal thought, and we live in a far from ideal world.

      <title>Russian Chicken Inspector</title>
      <link>http://gearchicken.com/blog/2014/02/04/russian-chicken-inspector.html</link>
      <description>&lt;![CDATA[Two weekends ago (the weekend of Janurary 24th) my friend Alec and I worked on a game for this year's Global Game Jam.  The theme of this year's jam was:

&quot;We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are.&quot;

I interpreted that to mean that how you interact with the world around you changes how the world interacts back with you.  The night before the jam I had been browsing r/ProgrammerHumor a subreddit dedicated to awful and hysterical programming related jokes.  While on /r/ProgrammerHumor I discovered Chicken, and after a four minute lightning-talk I had the word chicken branded into my short-term memory.

At the start of the jam when the diversifiers were announced I was ecstatic to see Design, Create, Play - A challenge to create all of the content used in the game procedurally. Given that Alec and I are both programmers at heart this challenge was a must do!  After 48 hours of jamming, eating, caffiene powered programming binges, and occasionally passing out on the nearest couch we had created Russian Chicken Inspector!

[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;354&quot;] Russian Chicken Inspector Gameplay Screenshot[/caption]

The goal of Russian Chicken Inspector is to collect 1 million eggs (100,000 eggs for the version released at the end of the jam). The player is able to collect eggs in many different ways which are including but not limited to:


Picking Eggs Up Off the Ground!
Rescuing Chickens!
Being a Nice Person!



Chopping Down Trees!
Robbing Villagers!
Killing Chickens!
Deforestation!


Below is a link to the GitHub page for Russian Chicken Inspector.  Feel free to submit any issues or pull requests!
