<h2>Which project did your team choose?</h2>
<p>MonoGame</p>
<h2>2-liner description of the project?</h2>
<p>MonoGame is a port of Microsoft's XNA Game Framework to the Mono language. MonoGame takes the features provided by XNA and allows for cross-platform deployment.</p>
<h2>What will each team member's role be?</h2>
<p>Believable answer, something that might go as a title on a resume (emphasis on believable.)</p>
<h2>Source Code Repository URL?</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mono/MonoGame">https://github.com/mono/MonoGame</a></p>
<h2>What are the easy parts?</h2>
<ul>
<li>MonoGame is a very active project on GitHub (link provided above)</li>
<li>MonoGame has a somewhat active forum on codeplex.com ( <a href="http://monogame.codeplex.com/discussions">monogame.codeplex.com/discussions</a> )</li>
<li>The MonoGame Core Dev Team is very active on Twitter ( <a href="https://twitter.com/MonoGameTeam">https://twitter.com/MonoGameTeam</a> )</li>
</ul>
<h2>What are the hard parts?</h2>
<ul>
<li>MonoGame's IRC is only somewhat active, this will provide a <em>slight</em> challenge when trying to communicate with the core dev team.</li>
<li>While MonoGame is an active project it has a long-term development cycle. It's last release was over a year ago.</li>
</ul>
