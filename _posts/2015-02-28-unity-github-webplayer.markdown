The other day a friend asked me for some help setting up some demos on [his portfolio blog](http://joshualandman.me).
He wanted to be able to have playable versions of his Unity3D Projects online
so any vistor of his site could play the game easily, ideally without building
the project from source.

I helped him setup a gh-pages branch for [his project](https://github.com/joshualangman/shift)
and then made sure that his demo was the only thing inside of that branch.
After that he was able to post a link to his [online demo](http://joshualandman.github.io/shift/)
in a blog post on his portfolio.
