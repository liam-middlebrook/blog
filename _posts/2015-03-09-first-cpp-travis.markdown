This is a step by step guide on how to setup TravisCI for FIRST Robotics C++
repositories. It will cover getting build status from TravisCI, but it will
not go into unit testing. If you want to explore setting up Unit Tests for
your repository I would recommend looking into CUnit.

1. Create a Makefile for building your robot code.

Since TravisCI uses Ubuntu as an OS we'll need to create a Makefile for
actually building the robot code. I based my Makefile off of the file that
is generated by [brpylko/FRCMakeProject](https://github.com/brpylko/FRCMakeProject)

Here's the example of the Makefile that you could use.

    ```

    AT = @
    INCDIR = -I$(HOME)/wpilib/cpp/current/include -Isrc/
    CPPFLAGS += -g -Wall -W $(INCDIR) -std=c++14 -fPIC
    LFLAGS = -L$(HOME)/wpilib/cpp/current/lib -lwpi
    CXX = arm-frc-linux-gnueabi-g++
    TEAM = 3181
    RMCOMMAND = rm -f
    DEPLOYTARGET = roboRIO-$(TEAM).local
    
    SOURCES = $(wildcard src/*.cpp)
    HEADERS = $(wildcard src/*.h)
    OBJECTS = $(patsubst src/%.cpp,src/%.o,$(wildcard src/*.cpp))
    
    all: $(OBJECTS)
        test -d bin/ || mkdir -p bin/
        $(CXX) $(CPPFLAGS) $(OBJECTS) $(LFLAGS) -o bin/FRCUserProgram
    ```

2. Create a .travis.yml file for TravisCI Configuration

This file will tell TravisCI what it needs to do in order to properly
test and build your code. We're going to set the language to be CPP
and tell TravisCI to get the following dependencies.

* [WPILib](http://github.com/brpylko/wpilib.git)

* [FRC-Toolchain](https://launchpad.net/~byteit101/+archive/ubuntu/frc-toolchain)

Then all you need to do is tell TravisCI to run the Makefile to build
the code! I've attached a sample .travis.yml below!

    ```
    language: cpp
    before_install:
        - git clone git://github.com/brpylko/wpilib.git ~/wpilib
        - sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:byteit101/frc-toolchain
        - sudo apt-get update
    install:
        - sudo apt-get install frc-toolchain
    script:
        - make
    ```

3. Enable the TravisCI GitHub Webhook

Sign into TravisCI and you'll see a list of all the repositories that
you have administrator access to. All you need to do is flip the switch
and next time you push or receive a pull request you'll have TravisCI
checking your build status.
