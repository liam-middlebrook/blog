The other day in Advanced FOSS we were joined by Russ, a recruiter from Google.
He talked to us a lot about the process of how to better our chances at being
accepted with a position with Google. Russ also talked about his unique journey
that led him to his current position with Google (Apple -> Microsoft -> Google).
