At this month's RocPY meeting [@ryansb](http://rsb.io) came
to Rochester to talk about [HFLOSSK](https://github.com/decause/hflossk).

While this was the main focus of this month's RocPY meeting, I was also
encouraged to give a lightning talk about some [work](https://github.com/liam-middlebrook/missing-license)
and [other frivolity](http://reddit.com/r/decausegonewild).
As one may imagine my professor [Remy DeCausemaker](https://github.com/decause)
was pleased with the talk.
