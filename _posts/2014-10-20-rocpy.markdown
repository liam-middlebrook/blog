title: "RocPy: Other Languages With Python"
tags: [ADVFOSS, Community]

For this month's RocPy the topic was interfacing other
languages with Python. This seemed like a wonderful idea
because for the majority of projects that my friends
and I work on we use languages other than Python.

Sadly this meeting was less successful than what
I had expected it to be. A large portion of the 
meeting was spent talking about interfacing
Python with more "legacy" languages like Fortran.
We also didn't have enough time to do lightning talks
for this RocPy because of the amount of information
that was in this talk.
