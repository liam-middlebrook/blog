<p>Two weekends ago (the weekend of Janurary 24th) my friend Alec and I worked on a game for this year's Global Game Jam.  The theme of this year's jam was:</p>
<blockquote><p>"We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are."</p></blockquote>
<p>I interpreted that to mean that how you interact with the world around you changes how the world interacts back with you.  The night before the jam I had been browsing <a title="r/ProgrammerHumour" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programmerhumor" target="_blank">r/ProgrammerHumor</a> a subreddit dedicated to awful and hysterical programming related jokes.  While on /r/ProgrammerHumor I discovered <a title="Chicken" href="http://torso.me/chicken" target="_blank">Chicken</a>, and after a four minute lightning-talk I had the word chicken branded into my short-term memory.</p>
<p>At the start of the jam when the diversifiers were announced I was ecstatic to see <em>Design, Create, Play - </em>A challenge to create all of the content used in the game procedurally. Given that Alec and I are both programmers at heart this challenge was a must do!  After 48 hours of jamming, eating, caffiene powered programming binges, and occasionally passing out on the nearest couch we had created Russian Chicken Inspector!</p>

<p>The goal of Russian Chicken Inspector is to collect 1 million eggs (100,000 eggs for the version released at the end of the jam). The player is able to collect eggs in many different ways which are including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Picking Eggs Up Off the Ground!</li>
<li>Rescuing Chickens!</li>
<li>Being a Nice Person!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Chopping Down Trees!</li>
<li>Robbing Villagers!</li>
<li>Killing Chickens!</li>
<li>Deforestation!</li>
</ul>
