Sadly this months RocPy took to the trend of long talks
which for the majority of the students could be deemed
as 'stale'.

Luckily we were able to have lightning talks this meeting
since we started the meeting off with lightning talks
while waiting for some of the organizers to show up.

I'm excited for next month's RocPy since it will be
the HFOSS finals and will be hosted in the
[MAGIC Center](http://magic.rit.edu).
