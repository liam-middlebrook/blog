<p>For my Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software class I was assigned to find a bug in a GitHub repository and to submit a pull request with a patch for the bug.  About a month ago I had discovered a python game development library known as Spyral. I have been watching Spyral for the past few weeks and decided to find a bug that was simple enough for someone with my python experience to handle. Here is a link to the pull request that I submitted to Spyral.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/platipy/spyral/pull/39">https://github.com/platipy/spyral/pull/39</a></p>
<p>When I submitted my pull request I had a great experience interacting with the lead developer <a href="https://github.com/acbart">acbart</a>. He answered my question within a day of me submitting the pull request and helping to think out a solution to the issue that the bug presented. While ultimately my bugfix has not been implemented, I'd like to think that by submitting it I helped <a href="https://github.com/acbart">acbart</a> work out a framework design choice for Spyral.</p>
