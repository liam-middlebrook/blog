<p><strong>What:</strong></p>
<p>Common Rhetological Fallacies</p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong></p>

<p><strong>When:</strong></p>
<p>Released April, 2012</p>
<p><strong>The Gist:</strong></p>
<p><em>This image contains lists of example of different common rhetological fallacies. Each fallacy comes with an example, and a small descriptive image to represent the fallacy.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Good:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pictures are Easy to Understand</li>
<li>Fallacies are sorted into color-coded sections</li>
<li>All the sources are cited at the bottom of the image</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Bad:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the fallacies may seem oversimplified</li>
<li type="_moz">All of the authors and citations appear at the very bottom of the image, where the sources are in a small font</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What fallacies did not make onto the list and why?</li>
<li>How can reading this document help public speakers with the art of rhetoric?</li>
<li>Could some of the sections be split into smaller subsections (while still remaining useful)?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I found this list of fallacies interesting; when reading through the examples I found quite a few fallacies that I commonly use in arguments. I hope if I were to get nothing else from this picture that it helps me eliminate the use of those fallacies in my speech. 9/10 Dropped Packets</p>
