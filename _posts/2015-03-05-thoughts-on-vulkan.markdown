title: "Thoughts on Vulkan (f.k.a. GLNext)"

Earlier today at the [Game Developers Conference](http://gdconf.com) in San
Fansisco the [Khronos Group](http://khronos.org) presented the next version,
or rather the successor to OpenGL. [Vulkan](http://khronos.org/vulkan) is a
lower level Graphics API that puts developers in control of the hardware,
rather than leaving all of the "heavy lifting" to the driver.

From the looks of it Vulkan will have a much steeper learning curve
than OpenGL has had in the past. Although that will be at the trade-off
of getting a lot more performance out of GPUs without worrying about driver
overhead. I'm really excited to see how Vulkan and it's spec develops in the
next six months (I've heard rumors that the spec should be ready around Sept.
or Oct.)
