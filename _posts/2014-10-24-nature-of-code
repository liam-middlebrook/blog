In the Game Development program at RIT we take a course titled Interactive
Media Development. The first half of this course uses the Processing Framework
in order to focus more on the development of AI as opposed to the graphical
backend. The book that is referenced for this course is
[The Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com) by Daniel Shiffman.

In chapter 5 of *The Nature of Code* Shiffman covers using physics libraries
in conjunction with processing for more realistic simulations. One of the
libraries that he mentions is Box2D for Processing (formerly PBox2D). Last year
he changed the name of the library over but had forgotten to update his book
and it's tutorials. I decided to open a [pull request](https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code/pull/21)
that fixed the confusion between PBox2D and Box2D for Processing.
