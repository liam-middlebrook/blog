title: "OpenGL Water"

Over the summer I decided that I wanted to spend some more time
messing around with OpenGL and creating cool demos. One of the demos
that I ended up spending a lot of my time on a Water demo.

The water produced in this demo is all predetermined by different
wave displacement maps. It is intended to have very small amplitude waves
and to be more of background water rather than for the user to see the waves
working close up. This is because I'm not actually manipulating vertex data
but rather just calculating the color for each fragment depending on its
position.
