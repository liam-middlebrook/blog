<p><strong>The Gist:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://rit.edu">RIT</a> along with <a href="http://att.com">AT&amp;T</a>, <a href="http://digitalrochester.com">Digital Rochester</a>, <a href="http://htr.org">High Tech Rochester</a>, and <a href="http://hackupstate.com">Hack Upstate</a> will be hosting a 60 day app creation challenge based around creating an app that exposes civic resources to the average citizen <a href="http://attroc.hackupstate.com">[Link Here]</a>.Â  Every sponsor of the event is clearly stating that they are doing it to once again start up Rochester's tech sector, hopefully bringing it back to the peak of the <a href="http://kodak.com">Kodak</a> and <a href="http://xerox.com">Xerox</a> years.</p>
<p><strong>The Good:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The fact that recognition of the tech community in Rochester is happening from companies</li>
<li>The promotion of creating a more transparent government to help facilitate communication with citizens</li>
<li>The promotion of the <a href="http://opensource.org">Open Source Initiative</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Bad:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The challenge lasts an entire 60 days, which leaves ideas to a test of time. If a developer loses their passion for an idea the overall challenge loses a bit of quality.</li>
<li>The press conference looked more like companies trying to improve their public image</li>
<li>The Open Source Initiative was mentioned, rather than the <a href="http://fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a> (It seems that this is a recurring bulletin in "The Bad" for my posts)</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall attending the conference was a good experience. It helped me realize who would be looking at the apps that are created during the challenge.</p>
