This year for [Software Freedom Day](http://softwarefreedomday.org/) I attended
[FOSS@RIT](http://foss.rit.edu)'s day long event. For part of the event
[@decause](https://github.com/decause) encouraged everyone to give lightning
talks. I wasn't originally planning on giving a lightning talk until
[@Nolski](https://github.com/nolski) decided I should give a talk about
decause. I was thrilled by this idea and quickly scrapped up a presentation
that I named [Decause Wat!?](http://gearchicken.com/decause_wat.pdf).
