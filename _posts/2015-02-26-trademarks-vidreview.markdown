## Who
Karen Sandler

## What / Where
[All Things Open 2014 | Karen Sandler | Trademarks and Your FOSS Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JY6AtbtAuts)

## The Gist
Karen Sandler is a lawyer who sits on the board of directors for the GNOME
Foundataion. She goes into detail about how Trademark policies effect
FOSS projects, and how to go about taking legal action when needed.

## The Good
* Talks about her relevance to the issues at hand

* She mentions [SugarLabs](http://sugarlabs.org)

* Avoided use of legalise during the talk

## The Bad
* Read the same information as the slides (rather than further iteration on
materials)

## In Review
I feel like the vidreviews are a lot more engaging than most litreviews.
Maybe that's due to the media that they're presented on, or that because
there are less vidreviews they seem more enjoyable.
