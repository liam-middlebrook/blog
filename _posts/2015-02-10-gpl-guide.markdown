A Comprehensive Tutorial and Guide

## Where

## When
First Published 2008

## The Gist
A brief guide explaining how the GNU GPL works. It covers
the four freedoms that the GPL and copyleft protect, as well as
an analogy from Lawrence Lessig about software code versus legal code.

## The Good
* Gives a solid overview of Four Freedoms

* Gives great Lawrence Lessig legal analogy

* Gives overview of what Copyleft is

## The Bad
* Doesn't talk about why to/not to use GPL

## The Questions
* Why did they feel the need to stress that Free Software can also be
commercial?

* With new "anti-hacker" movements from the US Government hurt the
Software Freedom movement?

## In Review
I think that this is a great guide for people that have had zero
exposure to the GNU GPL. I didn't get much out of it, but that's okay
because now it's a known resource that I can show to others who are
interested in learning about Free Software.
