<h2>Preface:</h2>
<p>I have no easy way of describing all of the things that BarCamp is, so I have included the "official" description of BarCamp below, as according to their site <a href="http://barcamproc.org">http://barcamproc.org</a></p>
<blockquote><p>BarCamp Rochester is an ad-hoc gathering born from the desire for people to share and learn in an open environment. BarCamp Rochester is an intense event with <a href="http://barcamproc.org/attendees/">discussions, demos, and interaction from attendees</a>. All attendees should give a demo, a session, or help with one. All presentations are scheduled the day they happen. Prepare in advance, but come early to get a good slot on the schedule.</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year I was only able to attend a single talk at BarCamp due to some preoccupations that involve an aforementioned math class from my last blog post. Either way, the talk that I was able to attend wasn't quite "normal," to me, even for BarCamp's standards.</p>
<p>Given the nature of the entire presentation behind this talk I'm going to turn this into a constructive piece on how this speaker could have done better.</p>
<h2>The Talk:</h2>
<p>The name of the talk was "How to Not NOT Sell Video Games." I'm going to list off all the tips I can think off in a bulleted form:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't try to force audience interaction</li>
<li>Make sure that you project your voice, but avoid shouting at your audience</li>
<li>Practice your slide deck a few times before presenting it</li>
<li>Always be prepared for the worst of Murphy's Law</li>
<li>Check your facts before showing them to others</li>
<li>Don't hold your audience captive</li>
</ul>
