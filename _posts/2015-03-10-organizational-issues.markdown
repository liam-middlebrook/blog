## What / Where
[Legal Primer for FOSS: Chapter 3](http://bizlegfoss-ritigm.rhcloud.com/static/books/foss-primer.pdf)

## The Gist
The chapter describes the different forms that FOSS projects can exist in.
It covers the basic duties of each of those properties from corporations
to sole proprietors.

## The Good
* Good overview of different corporate entity types

* Easily Grokable

* Great walkthrough on the incorporation process

## The Bad
* Social issues still persist

* No overview of different non-corporate entity types

## The Questions
* How to manage liability?

* What other positions/roles are part of this process?

## In Review
Solid read, definitely would recommend to anyone starting their own FOSS
project that has potential for money-dollars. 9/10
