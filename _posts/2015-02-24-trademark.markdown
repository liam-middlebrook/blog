## What / Where
[Legal Primer for FOSS: Chapter 5](http://bizlegfoss-ritigm.rhcloud.com/static/books/foss-primer.pdf)

## The Gist
This chapter gave a great overview of how Trademark law works in the
United States. It also concluded with an example of what a FOSS project
`Project Foo` might do if a group of its users created `FooNews`.

## The Good
* Overview of Trademark Law

* Great descriptive example at the end

## The Bad
* Didn't touch on Trademark Law outside of the US

* Spent time on local Trademark Law (instead of national)

## The Questions
* Can two products used for different purposes share a trademark?

## In Review
This was one of the better readings from the FOSS Primer. I definitely
think that it should be a required reading for all students going into
a computing major in college.
