[Market Power and Regulation](http://bizlegfoss-ritigm.rhcloud.com/static/books/nobel-popular-economicsciences2014.pdf)

This snippet goes over some potential approaches to regulation of
the "Free Market." It's examples show the pros and cons of different
regulation strategies.

## The Good
* Good overview of different approaches

* Easily Grokable

* Great walkthrough on the pros/cons

## The Bad
* Little Dry

* Only a snippet (although probably an easier read then the award winning piece)

* What other positions/roles are part of this process?

## In Review
Okay read, but I'd only recommend it to people who were interested in
economics. 7/10
