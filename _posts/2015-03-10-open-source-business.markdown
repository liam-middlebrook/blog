## Who
* Bradley M. Kuhn.

* Anthony K. Sebro, Jr.

* Denver Gingerich

* Free Software Foundation, Inc.

* Software Freedom Law Center.

## What / Where
[Comprehensive GPL Guide Section 12.1](http://bizlegfoss-ritigm.rhcloud.com/static/books/comprehensive-gpl-guide.pdf#section.12.1)
[Open Source Case for Business: Advocacy](http://opensource.org/advocacy/case_for_business.php)

## The Gist
This basically talks about how GPL can be used in different cases for software
and then going onto how Open Source can help with businesses.

## The Good
* Governs development and distribution, not use.

* Short articles.

* Open Source is all around us.

## The Bad
* No smooth transitions.

* Mentioning software that isn't relevant doesn't help readers.

## The Questions
* Is the data behind the claims made provided anywhere?

* How can we show companies that `FOSS != !($)`

## In Review
Solid read, definitely would recommend to anyone starting their own FOSS
project that has potential for money-dollars. 9/10
