## Who
Software Freedom Law Center

## What / Where
[Legal Primer for FOSS: Chapter 4](http://bizlegfoss-ritigm.rhcloud.com/static/books/foss-primer.pdf)

## The Gist
Patents make developing FOSS Projects more difficult. It's a good idea to get [professional legal
advice](http://decau.se) from an educated lawyer.

## The Good
* Detailed advice for fighting patent claims

* Educates developers on the pros and cons of filing software patents

* Great guides on disaster response

## The Bad
* Needs more specific cases

* Everything is situational

* Only touches slightly on patent trolls

## The Questions
* How should developers combat patent trolls?

* Which FOSS licenses have patent clauses in them?

* What would a nice example patent be?

## In Review
Solid read, definitely would recommend to anyone starting their own FOSS
project. 9/10
