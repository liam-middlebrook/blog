## The Gist
Patents can hurt Free Software, because of this several large companies who
are friends of FOSS have created various patent promises. Basically a patent
promise is a gaurentee by a company that they will not use patents that they
have filed to protect the spread of FOSS.

## The Good
* Helps promote FOSS

* Ensures the longetivity of Open Development

## The Bad
* The fact these documents have to exist

* Everything is situational

* Needs patents for specific instances

## The Questions
* Are companies protecting themselves or FOSS communities?

## In Review
Solid read, definitely would recommend to anyone interested in advising
FOSS projects. 9/10
