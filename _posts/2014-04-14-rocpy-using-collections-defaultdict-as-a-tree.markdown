<p>Last month on Tuesday the 18th, students from both my HFOSS class as well asÂ students from the Advanced FOSS class were supposed to go to March's RocPy meeting. When I had arrived with my car, ready to carpool some of the students over I was the only person who had brought their car. After waiting for about 10 minutes nobody else had arrived with a vehicle that was suitable for driving others in. After making a few calls a few people gave up and decided not to go to RocPy. The remainder of us piled into my car and made the long (15 minute) journey to the University of Rochester.</p>
