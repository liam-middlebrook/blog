## Dance Pad Controller Refurbish
I've recently acquired an old Dance Dance
Revolution dance-pad controller. My plan for
this hack is to interface it with an Arduino
so it can be used as a virtual keyboard.

I *might* do this in C instead, because I'm
having slight issues with time delays in python.
