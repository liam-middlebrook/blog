## The Gist
Everything that is modern media is in one way or another a remix of an
existing work. This is easily apparent in baselines or chords of popular
music. A memorable message that was presented halfway through the film is
"Creation Inspires Influence."

## The Good
* Split into different parts for more digestable viewing.

* Abundance of examples to help keep viewers engaged.

* Mentions copying and remixes in inventions that aren't necesarily media.

## The Bad
* Lots of examples, sometimes to the point where the video felt repetitive.

* 
## The Questions
* At what point did Copyright, Patents, and Intellectual Property become more
harmful than their origional intentions?

* Is it wrong for companies to lobby for extending copyright and patent law expirations

## In Review

Everything is a remix gives a great overview of how everything in modern
culture is in one way a remix or rework of previous works. I like how towards the end
the video went into how some of the legal aspects of copyright work. I'd give this
video a 9/10 water bottles.
