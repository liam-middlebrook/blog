When I was at [GDC](http://gdconf.com) I stopped by the IGF booth and saw a
sign labeled "Frog Fractions 2." When I walked up to the booth I saw what
appeared to be a golfing game. I stood behind someone for about 10 minutes,
I was pretty confused, waiting for the change in gameplay that I remember from
the original [Frog Fractions](http://twinbeard.com/frog-fractions).
