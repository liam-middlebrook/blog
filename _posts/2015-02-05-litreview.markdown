## The Gist
A brief guide on different Free Software licenses that have been
released by the Free Software Foundation. This guide goes over
descriptions of how the licenses work and some situations in which
to choose those licenses.

## The Good
* Gives a solid overview of FSF Liceneses

* Gives references for later reading

* Gives simple differences between the licenses

## The Bad
* Strong emphasis on GPL

* Doesn't define things very well

* No real examples were given

## The Questions
* Why are companies allowed to have non-compete clauses?

* What things should be included in GPLv4?

* Will we see liceneses appear more frequently as time goes
on or will creation slow down after time?

## In Review
I think this was a great source and I'll probably check back on it
if I ever have questions about the different copyleft licenses.
