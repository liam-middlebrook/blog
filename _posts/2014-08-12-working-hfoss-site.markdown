This past week I've spent a lot of
time working on improving the [HFOSS
Website](http://hfoss-fossrit.rhcloud.com).
Being able to help out
with the course in my freetime is
part of the reason why I love the
ideals of Free Software.

Here's a list of some of the
features that I've helped add to
the site this past week.

* Per-Participant Profile Panges:
Each participant now has their own
profile page which can display several
stats/badges from sites like GitHub
and CoderWall

* Participants Listing Page
  
  * Lists current HFOSS students by default

  * Can select students by year and term.
    For example the url `/blogs/2014` would
    return all the HFOSS students from 2014.
