title: "24 Days of Pull Requests | Thrust"
tags: [ADVFOSS, Community, 24Pulls]

This is the start of a challenge to get a pull request out
every day for the next 24 days (every day until Christmas).

My first pull request was to [Thrust](https://github.com/ssternklar/Thrust), a
pacifist bullethell game created in Unity3D. The request that I made wasn't
very large, in fact it consisted in only a few tweaks to the README.md file.

I added a new section to the file that gave users a link to a playable build
of the game for in-browser play (hosted via Github.IO). I also changed the
formatting of the file so different sections would markdown header tags
rather than just have plaintext with colons after to designate sections.

Here's a link to the pull request I made for Thrust.
