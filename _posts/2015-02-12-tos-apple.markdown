## The Gist
Different Terms of Service and contributor agreements for iTunes, The Fedora
Project, and The Python Project. If you are involved in these products
(whether you are a user or developer for these projects).

## The Good
* I'm guarenteed to have a family
>   iOS 8 and/or OS X Yosemite are required to start and join a Family.

## The Bad
* Fedora has a default license agreement

## The Questions
* Why would the FPCA have a default license?

## In Review
Apple's TOS was a great read, it definitely gets a Energized Steve Ballmer out of Microsoft CEOs.
