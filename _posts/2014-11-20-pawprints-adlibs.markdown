At the beginning of the summer for the National Day of Civic Hacking
I worked on a project that took petitions from the White House's
[We the People](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/) website and
remixed them up with adlibs. Much like the Mad Libs style game. I've posted
the code for that up on [GitHub](https://github.com/liam-middlebrook/wethepeople-adlibs).

A few months ago RIT opened up a new petition service for Student Government
that they call [PawPrints](http://pawprints.rit.edu). Last week I decided to
update and remix my wethepeople-adlibs python script and make it use PawPrints.
[pawprints-adlibs](https://github.com/liam-middlebrook/pawprints-adlibs) is
on GitHub.
